# OpheliasOasis
This was a project for EECS3550, Software Engineering.

The assignment was to develop a hotel management application for a fictional hotel in the outback of Australia known as Ophelia's Oasis. To oversummarize, management must be able to set prices for rooms and employees must be able to make, change, and cancel different types of reservations on a customer's behalf, as well as check guests in and out. Full requirements can be found in Ophelia's Oasis.docx.
